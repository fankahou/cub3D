A 42 school project: RayCaster with miniLibX

This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which is
considered the first FPS ever created.

Note:
This is the final version of our project working together, which requires minilibx preinstalled.
For improved and integrated minilibx version made by Ka Hou, please visit:
